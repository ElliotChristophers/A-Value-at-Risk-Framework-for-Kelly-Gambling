We design a framework and a closed-form expression which allows a bettor to adjust their invested stake on a repeated gambling game subject to a prescribed value at risk. Given a betting opportunity, which the gambler can repeat a given number of times, or a collection of distinct betting opportunities at different moments in time, the bettor can calculate exactly what fraction of their capital, in a variation of the Kelly criterion, to stake in order to have a desired probability of exceeding losses of a certain magnitude.
